## Usage

- Change language from en-US to your locale in the ViewController.swift
- Fill Field enum with your custom form data as in the below.
- Profit!

```
enum Field: String, Iteratable{
    case name = "My name is"
    case surname = "my surname is"
    case birthPlace = "I was born in"
    case phoneNumber = "my number is"
}
```

Thanks.
